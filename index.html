The discs were originally made of rubber and later out of vinyl. We have been using technology like this for over 120 years. The record player, it's modern cousin, is still a favorite of many audiophiles.</p>

                    <h1>The Future</h1>
                    <p> What will the future of audio playback technology hold for us? Will we be directly plugged into music through our skulls or forced to puchase implants that contantly stream the top 40 in our heads? If we keep going in the same direction, music will no longer be a thing that is shared, rather a implanted part or us for no one eles to know, like a part of our personality. I say, we all gather around the music together again.
